                <h2>Parts and requests</h2>
                <h3>Who receives my email and questions?</h3>
                <p align="justify">Our <a href="contact.html">customer service</a> team receives all email requests. Feel free to ask us any questions you have. Our goal is to make sure that the part you get is the part you need.<br/>
With your email request, please include as much detail as possible about your order or the item you are looking for. Also, include the <a href="vin-decoder.html">VIN</a>, the name of the part you are looking for, and any other relevant information, when applicable.
</p>
<h3>Why can't I browse parts by location?</h3>
<p align="justify">
We have more than 78+ locations all over USA, and we ship parts from our warehouses within 24 hours. That means if you search by location, you may not see the part you need. But we still may have it in stock nearby! To ensure you receive your part as quickly as possible, when you place your order we quickly locate the closest warehouse that has your part in stock to ship it right to you.
<br/>
In short, we're not limited to location, and we don't want you to miss out on great deals.
</p>
<h3>How does SwiftAutoPart  know what auto parts fit my request?</h3>
<p align="justify">
Any request you send us is dispatched to <a href="contact.html">Customer Service</a> experts who have many years of experience and broad knowledge of auto and truck parts. Furthermore, our comprehensive database helps us determine the year, make, and model of your vehicle to locate compatible parts.
<br/>
If you see any part that you believe will work, please contact a sales representative before ordering,especially if it does not show up under the listings of exact matches.
<br/>
We also guarantee that if our database shows a part will fit and work correctly, but you find that it is not the correct fit, we cover the cost of the part and shipping through our 30-day no-hassle warrant.
</p>
<h2>Returns and refunds</h2>
<h3>May I return a part if it does not fit?</h3>
<p align="justify">Yes. If we recommended a part that is marked on our website as compatible with your vehicle but isn't, you are covered under our 30-day no-hassle warranty.</p>
<h3>May I return a part if it is the wrong color?</h3>
<p align="justify">We cannot accept part returns due to color mismatches or guarantee color to match your vehicle. We sell used OEM auto parts from various makes and models, with varying color shadings and changes. Color differences may result from such factors as environmental effects and degrees of wear. Therefore we cannot guarantee a part that will fit your vehicle will also be an accurate color match. We recommend consulting with an automotive painting professional to match the used part to your vehicleâ€™s color. We also cannot accept returned parts that have been painted after purchase.</p>
<h3>What can I do if I receive a damaged part?</h3>
<p align="justify">If you receive a damaged part, you must sign for the shipment as "received damaged". The shipping company will then be responsible for the damaged part.
<br/>
After receiving and signing for the part, contact our <a href="contact.html">Customer Service</a> team at <a href="tel:+18333229383">(855) 501-3659</a>, and we'll assist you with the claim and replacement process.
</p>
<h2>Shipping and delivery</h2>
<h3>When can I expect delivery of my order?</h3>
<p align="justify">You can expect most packages to be delivered within five to 10 business days.
<br/>
We process your order within 24 business hours after receipt of full payment, and items will leave our facilities within two business days after processing.
<br/>
We provide you with tracking information via email 24 to 48 hours after your item has shipped.Please ensure you have provided us with a valid email address, and check your spam or junk folder as communications from car-partusa may not make it past your filter, depending on your settings.
<br/>
If after 10 business days you haven't received your order, please contact our shipping department at <a href="mailto:carpartssolutions.com" target="_blank">carpartssolutions.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Why was my order delayed?</h3>
<p align="justify">Your order may be delayed if we are missing information necessary for processing. If this is the case, we will email you within 48 hours of receiving your order. Please check your spam or junk folder as communications from car-partusa may not make it past your filter, depending on your settings.
<br/>
If you have not received an email from us and have not received your order after 10 days, please contact our shipping department at <a href="mailto:carpartssolutions.com" target="_blank">carpartssolutions.com</a>
<br/>
Remember that we cannot ship to a post office box or an APO. If you order a freight item (such as <a href="seat-front.html">seats</a>, <a href="engine.html">engines</a>, <a href="transmission-assembly.html">transmissions</a>, running boards, or <a href="bumper.html">bumpers</a>), we must have your business name, physical address, and daytime phone number.
</p>
<h3>Will there be a handling fee for my order?</h3>
<p align="justify">Yes. The handling fee covers packaging materials needed to provide the safe arrival of your purchase. We typically include this fee with the shipping charge.</p>
<h3>Can I arrange my own shipping?</h3>
<p align="justify">No. We use very carefully selected commercial carriers to provide the best US coverage and care for your products. We therefore do not allow customers to arrange for their own shipping. By letting us package items, select the best shipping method, and coordinate freight pick-ups, you are guaranteed the most secure and efficient shipping course at the best possible price.</p>
<h3>Will you ship freight items to Canada or elsewhere outside the US?</h3>
<p align="justify">car-partusa  will only ship to the continental <a href="junkyard-near-me.html">48 United States</a>. At this time, we cannot ship to Hawaii, Alaska, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, or elsewhere overseas.</p>
<h3>What shipping methods does car-partusa use?</h3>
<p align="justify">We ship more than 75 percent of our items via UPS Ground service. We do not use the United States Postal Service, and therefore cannot ship to a post office box or APO address. Occasionally, we ship ground packages via FedEx. Large or oversized items(motors, <a href="transmission-assembly.html">transmissions</a>, seats, <a href="wheel.html">wheels</a>, <a href="bumper.html">bumpers</a>, and tires) will ship via LTL Freight Carriers.</p>
<h3>How will you ship my <a href="engine.html">engine</a>, <a href="bumper.html">bumper</a>, <a href="seat-front.html">seat</a>, or other large item?</h3>
<p align="justify">For large items such as those mentioned above, we ship via less-than-truckload (LTL) freight carriers.
<br/>
The costs to ship these types of items begin at $100 and can exceed $1,000 for complete <a href="engine.html">engines</a> with <a href="transmission-assembly.html">transmissions</a> or transaxles. In most cases, we place and band these items on 4x4 or 6x6 pallets, and cover or wrap them.
<br/>
We must ship these parts to a commercial address with docking and forklift capabilities. If you do not have a location such as this available to you, we can ship the items to the closest freight terminal to your ZIP code.
<br/>
For an additional $100 charge, we will ship to a commercial address without a loading dock or to a residential address using a delivery truck with a lift gate. Your products will be unloaded only at the curb. We cannot unload onto a driveway or into a garage. Please make arrangements to move your items from the curb to a secure location.
<br/>
Upon delivery of your order, you should immediately inspect the cartons for any damage that may have occurred during shipment. Carefully inspect the packaging as well as its contents. It is normal for the carton to show some wear.
<br/>
The shipping charge does not include removal of any pallets, cartons, or other packaging materials.
<br/>
The freight trucking company is not responsible for unloading the items from the truck, or carrying the parts into your building. Your item is likely to be heavy and large, and therefore we recommend having a forklift or other help unloading and moving the item. The total shipping charge does not include inside delivery or removal of cartons.
</p>
<h3>Why does it cost so much to ship <a href="air-bag.html">airbags</a>?</h3>
<p align="justify"><a href="air-bag.html">Airbags</a> are considered hazardous materials by the U.S. Department of Transportation, and therefore require special packaging and care to ship properly and safely.
<br/>
Up to two <a href="air-bag.html">airbags</a> can be combined for shipping if they ship from the same location. We cannot combine shipping if multiple <a href="air-bag.html">airbags</a> in one order ship from different locations. <a href="air-bag.html">Airbags</a> do not include the module, unless otherwise stated.
</p>
<h3>I live in New York State. Why can't I buy a used airbag from you?</h3>
<p align="justify">Due to a New York State law banning the installation of used airbag equipment in vehicles, car-partusa cannot ship <a href="air-bag.html">airbags</a> to residents of the State of New York.
<br/>
We also cannot ship <a href="air-bag.html">airbags</a> to any location outside the continental United States, including Alaska, Canada, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. No air shipments of <a href="air-bag.html">airbags</a> are allowed.
<br/>
To learn more about HAZMAT items and the reasons for the high cost of shipping an airbag, visit www.dot.gov.
</p>
<h3>Free Shipping Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p align="justify">Free ground shipping applies to orders shipped to address in the continental United States and excludes Alaska and Hawaii. Shipping to a Post Office box or APO address is not available. Free Shipping excludes <a href="wheel.html">wheels</a>, <a href="transmission-assembly.html">transmissions</a>, axels and any product that ships via freight. car-partusa is not responsible for return shipping costs. Offer cannot be combined with any other offer, discount, special pricing or promotion. car-partusa reserves the right to cancel or modify this offer at any time without notice.</p>

<h2>Warranties</h2>
<h3>What sort of warranty will I receive with my purchase?</h3>
<p align="justify">
All items sold through car-partusa except <a href="air-bag.html">airbags</a>, <a href="seat-belt.html">seat belt</a> assemblies, and <a href="wheel.html">tires</a> (sold "as is") carry a free six-month warranty. Prices of these extended warranties vary according to each part. Should there be any defect in a part we ship, we guarantee to replace it, repair it, or refund your purchase price. See our Warranty page.
</p>
<h3>Can I pay for or pick up my car-partusa order at a local plant?</h3>
<p align="justify">No. All car-partusa orders must be paid in full at the time of ordering, before we can ship any products. Also, because the parts must be shipped via UPS or freight carrier, we do not offer local pickup.

<h3>I have already paid for my item but still owe sales tax. How do I pay for that?</h3>
<p align="justify">
We accept both wire transfers and all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Discovery, and American Express) for sales tax payments.  If your bank account with car-partusa shows a balance, we will contact you using information provided at checkout to arrange for payment.
<br/>
To pay by phone with a credit card, please call our office at <a href="tel:+18333229383">(855) 501-3659</a>.
